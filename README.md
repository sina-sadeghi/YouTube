Hi.
this is my fierst project.
this is just for practice and show my skills.
------------------------------------
For the program to work properly,
add node_modules next to this file as well as the users folder and
activate the same users folder in cmd and then 
activate the project itself.
-------------------------------------
Please, users living in Iran to view the site, first turn on their filter breaker.

First, let me say that this project is fully responsive for laptops, tablets and mobile phones.
And also written by React.
When the site opens, you are on the home page.
The header of the site is displayed first, then the menu bar and some of the best recent YouTube videos
Clicking on the plus sign at the end will increase their number.

After that, some of the best YouTube channels are displayed, and at the end, the site's footer displays information to contact me.
By clicking on the photo of each video, you will be transferred to another page that will display that video for you.
At the bottom, the complete information of that video is displayed, and at the end, the channel that uploaded that video is displayed.
There is a section called profile in the menu.
  By clicking on it or clicking on login in the header, you will enter the login section of the site with Google
  You can click on the login with Google button directly in the header instead.

After entering, the save button will be displayed in the videos, which you can use to save the desired video.
If you go to the profile in the menu after logging in through Google, a table with your information will be displayed.
You can enter the new page and update your information through the edit information button, except for the email, which cannot be edited.
The form information is fully validated and you cannot leave a field empty or fill in the wrong format.
After registration, their information will be saved and will be displayed in your updated information table.
Also, if you save a video, you can view all of them in chronological order in the saved section of the bar menu.
  Also, the exit button in the menu bar, like the exit button in the header, will make you exit the user environment and the save video command will be taken from you.

If you are logged in, you will see that your email and photo are displayed in the header, and if you are logged out, the login button and your picture will be displayed.
There is also a search section in the header where you can search for words and watch related videos.

Good luck ;)
